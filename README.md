## 🧑‍💻 Setup and Installation

### Steps to Run the App

🧐 Application Overview
📅 Calendar Grid
The main component of the app is the Calendar Grid. It displays a calendar with days of the month. Users can navigate between months using the Previous and Next buttons. Each day is clickable, and when a user clicks on a day, the Event Modal opens for them to add or view events.

🗂️ Event List Panel
On the right side of the calendar, the Event List Panel shows all events for the currently selected date. The events are displayed with their names, times, and descriptions. Each event has a Delete button that allows the user to remove it from the calendar.

🎉 Event Modal
The Event Modal appears when a user clicks on a specific date. Inside the modal, users can view details of events and also add new events for that date. The modal closes when the user clicks the Close button.

🔄 State Management
State is managed using React's Context API, allowing global state management for events and the currently selected date. This approach makes it easier to pass down state and actions to nested components.
